  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>
    I have had a lifelong career in computer technology and information systems. 
    <br>
    <br> 
    I began my career with service in the US Navy where I was trained 
    in computer hardware repairs and operations. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I continued my career in the business world working with minicomputers and 
    associated software in the accounting , banking and trust industries. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This was followed with a long career in the agricultural industry developing, maintaining and supporting database systems 
    in the cattle feeding industry. 
    <br>

    I am currently retired, but looking for ways to continue providing technology 
    services on the web.
